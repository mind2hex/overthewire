1.- Once connected to the ssh server with the credentials bandit1:boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1
    we need to cat a file in the home directory, but there is a problem.
    the filename is "-" so if we try:
$ cat -
    that may be because the file has a "-" as the name and because - is used for the arguments
    it is not interpreted as the filename
    Example: cat -h 

    So how we read the file?
$ cat < -
$ cat ./-
