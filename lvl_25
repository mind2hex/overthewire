1.- Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easyâ€
¦ The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Fi
    and out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

    the shell that is using bandit26 user is /usr/bin/showtext
$ cat /usr/bin/showtext
#!/bin/sh

export TERM=linux

more ~/text.txt
exit 0

     But we already have a ssh private key in our home directory so when we
     try to log in using the private key it inmediately closes because of the
     shell that bandit26 is usin (that is a shell script /usr/bin/showtext)
     so we can gain access reducing our terminal size stopping the command more
     and executing commands inside more

     for example we can press key "v" to execute vi and from vi we can read
     the password file (/etc/bandit_pass/bandit26) using :e/etc/bandit_pass/bandit26
