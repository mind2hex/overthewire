1.- The challenge here is try to get a shell
    When we start a session using the private key in bandit25 home directory for user
    bandit26, the predefined shell (/usr/bin/showtext) take us out of the session
    after displaying a message using the command more.
    We can reduce the size of the window in such a way that the more command does not 
    finish executing and lets us execute console commands within "more", in this way 
    we can execute vi by pressing ":v"

    Once inside vi, we set the shell variable
:set shell=/bin/sh

and then we run a shell session
:!sh

When we start the shell, we need to execute the script in home directory
$ ./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27
