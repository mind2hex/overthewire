1.- We need to find the password for the setuid binary file check

    If we use radare2, we can see that there is a string comparasion between
    s1 and s2, (strcmp(s1,s2)). So because in the disassembled code s2 = "sex"
    we can deduce the right password for executing the system("/bin/sh") function
    and read the password for user leviathan2
