1.- A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for 
    bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 
    4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going 
    through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.

    threads.

$ nc localhost 30002
