1.- A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron,
    the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the 
    configuration and see what command is being executed.

## Let's go see cronjob files
$ cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit22
@reboot bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null

## It shows that /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh is executing
$ /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
chmod: changing permissions of '/tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv': Operation not permitted
/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh: line 3: /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv: Permission denied

## it looks like the program is trying to change file permission of /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
$ cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
