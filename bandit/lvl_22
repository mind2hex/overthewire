1.- A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, 
    the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the 
    configuration and see what command is being executed.

## First thing to do is see what says the cron file
$ cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit23
@reboot bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null

## Now we know which program is being executed so let's check out 
## what is the program doing.   ( Commentin script works )
$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)  # mytarget is where the flag is writted

echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget" 

cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget

## So now we know how the flag is generated
$ cat /tmp/$(echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1) # This is where bandit23 is writting the password
