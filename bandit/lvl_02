1.- The challenge here is similar to the first one, in this challenge we see
    a file that use spaces in his name so if we try:
$ cat spaces in this filename
    cat will interpret every word in the sentence "spaces in this filename" as
    a file

    Solution:
$ cat 'spaces in this filename'
$ cat "spaces in this filename"
$ cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
