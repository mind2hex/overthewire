1.- in this file we need to cat a hidden file.
    hidden files are files that start with "."
    example:
       ".bashrc" is a hidden file located in $HOME directory
   
    by default, hidden files doesn't show when we use ls so we need
    to use ls -a to show every single file in the current or specified directory
$ ls -a inhere/
. .. .hidden
$ cat inhere/.hidden
