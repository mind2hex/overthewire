1.- We need to find a file somewhere with the next charateristics:
     
    human-readable
    1033 bytes in size
    not executable

    So we gonna use find command
$ find ./inhere/ -type f \! -executable -size 1033c
./inhere/maybeher07/.file2

    Explanation of find command:
      ./inhere/      # directory to search
      -type f        # specifying the file type, file in this case
      \! -executable # \! tells the program that the file must be no executable
      -size 1033c    # size specification in bytes

$ cat ./inhere/maybehere07/.file2
