1.- We need to do almost the same thing that the previous challenge

$ cd $(mktemp ....)
$ git clone ... # with the same password

    Once we are inside the git repo, we need to do a checkout to a previous commit
    because the actual README.md file doesn't contain the password

$ git checkout c086d11a00c0648d095d04c089786efef5e01264
$ cat README.md
